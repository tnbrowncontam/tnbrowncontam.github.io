His Ph.D. thesis, titled “Automated Methods in Chemical Risk Assessment”, was supervised by Professor Frank Wania, at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus. After his Ph.D. he was a Postdoc at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig, Germany, where he did research in the Analytical Environmental Chemistry group with Professor Kai-Uwe Goss. He was then a Postdoc at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, in the research group of Russell Boyd (retired). More recently he worked for three years as a Physical Scientist in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada where he worked on modelling oil properties and the chemistry of oil spills within the Centre for Offshore Oil, Gas and Energy Research (COOGER) headed by Tom King. Right now Dr. Brown collaborates extensively with Jon Arnot, doing subcontracting for ARC Arnot Research and Consulting.
